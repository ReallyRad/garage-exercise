we are running a small repair shop, called . Our shop can repair a bunch of vehicles, from cars to motorbikes to bicycles.
We have two employees in our shop, called Greg and Bob. Greg is a seasonned mechanic while Bob is just an apprentice.
Bob is only able to fix bicycles by himself, and Greg will take twice as much time as when his apprentice is not available.
It takes a seasonned mechanic 1 day to fix a car, and half a day to fix a motorbike and a quarter day to fix bicycles. 
Whenever a repair is accepted, the garage has the tradition to accept the transaction saying "Thanks for trusting our garage! Come back next morning as if nothing had happened"
Everyday in the city some vehicles need to be fixed, some people try to get to some garages to get them fixed but there are not always mechanics available to fix their vehicles. So they go aroung the city looking for a garage to fix their vehicle. 
There are several garages around the city with a different number of employees and different skills. 

Write a simulation of the life of a city where people wake up trying to get their vehicles fixed and others are mechanics and go to work in the morning and have to accept or reject clients depending on how much work they have to do that day.
